# hello-world
Creating my first Github repository... woot!

Hello. My name is Franklin and I'm learning to code in Swift for fun with the end goal of creating my very own app!
I'm going to use Github to store my work.

If I'm working on simple projects to learn how to code in Swift, I will make the repository public.
However, if the code project is for my app idea, it will remain private for now. It's super-secret, duh!

Once I'm finished, if there is a cool part of my app that I can section out and share publicly, then I will certainly do that!
